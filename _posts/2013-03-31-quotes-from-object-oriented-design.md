## Intro

I'm reading [Object Oriented Design With
Applications](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=0805300910)
by [Grady Booch]() and there are so many good quotes that I wanted to gather
them in one place.

All credit goes to Grady Booch. Please take time to check out his book for more.

## Chapter 1

> We observe that this inherent complexity derives from four elements: the
> complexity of the problem domain, the difficulty of managing the develpmental
> process, the flexibility possible through software, and the problems of
> characterizing the behavior of discrete systems.

<hr>

> The fundamental task of the software development team is to engineer the
> illusion of simplicity.

<hr>

> With a team of developers, the key management challenge is always to maintain
> a unity and integrity of design.

<hr>

> We try to design our systems with a seperation of concerns, so that the
> behavior in one part of a system has minimal impact on the behavior in
> another.

<hr>

> Since we have neither the mathematical tools nor the intellectual capacity to
> model the complete behavior of large discrete systems, we must be content with
> acceptable levels of confidence regarding their correctness.

<hr>

> Rarely would a builder think about adding a new sub-basement to an existing
> 100-story building; to do so would be very costly and would undoubtedly invite
> failure. Amazingly, users of software systems rarely think twice about asking
> for equivalent changes. Besides, they argue, it is only a simple matter of
> programming.

<hr>

> There are simply not enough good developers around to create all the new
> software that users need.

<hr>

> As systems evolve, objects that were once considered complex become the
> primitive objects upon which more complex systems are built.

<hr>

> A sound design method is based upon a solid theoretical foundation, yet offers
> degrees of freedom for artistic innovation.
