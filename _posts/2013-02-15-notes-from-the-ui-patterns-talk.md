Modals and popovers are basically the same UI. The difference is that modals are
often full screen and can get triggered by async data loading and not just user
interaction.

A date picker is basically a popover and a carousel.

## Goals

* Appear visually centered
* Can appear and dis in sreponse to user interaction
* Creaive primitive UI components that can be reused and shared
* Handle rapid clicks
