## Summary

 A lot of the stuff that we do everyday we can do smarter. And we should expect
 more from our tools. It will completely change the way you create websites.

## Demos Visual Studio text editing

* Showing how Visual studio has jshint built in and runs your javascript in real
time in the text editor.
* Shows CSS editing in VS with a color picker, eyedropper, and Cntrl^shift up and down to dynamically update the hex value
* Hover over a selector to get the specificity
* Hover over properties and see which versions of which browsers support that property
* Hover over a font name to get a preview of the font in different font-sizes and font-weights
* Edit a single vender prefixed property and all the other vendor prefixed properties stay in sync
* Easily embed an image as base 64 string
* Helps out with IE 6 and 7
* Hover over the image for a thumbnail preview
* Easily optimize images losslessly and easily reembed. There is currently no warning if the images get out of sync. Should be trivial to implement. I'll do it. :-]

## Less
* Working with less lets you easily see what it compiles to.
* It will recognize multiple uses of a hex value and suggest creating a variable
* Statement completion
* Hover over a mixin to see the exact contents

## CoffeeScript

* On save update the preview window

## Markdown

* Works the same way
